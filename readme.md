"Mudding Through March" - Mobile First Landing Page

--- Synopsis / Summary ---

Single page / mobile first landing page specifically designed to support promotional offer (30% of product range). 

Mobile first strategy was key due to using Google Ad-Words to generate traffic and targeting mobile devices.  

A simnple visual layout and friendly UX were the main objectives (and ultimately to drive traffic to the main brand website).  I wanted to utilise Flexbox for responsive breakpoints and also experiment with linear gradients and drop shadows to enhance the look & feel.
